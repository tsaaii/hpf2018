Thanks Alik( Priceton University) and Christian ( University of Mary land) for collecting, cleaning and processing data.

This work was done at Princeton University which apparently is the first trained model for ASL signs. Feel free to use them.

onboard.mlmodel file can classify a,e,i,o,u,l,k,s,h,t,r,w,n hand symbols which accounts for 60% of the most common used words in English.

atoe.mlmodel can classify a,b,c,d,e

test.mlmodel can classify a to z and del, space, nothing hand symbols.


You can use this model in CoreML to create an iOS application. This model doesn't need internet and is capable of classifying objects locally on the fly.

TranslateAR is our final model which can classify a symbol and render its label in AR. You can download it and run on your xcode.
